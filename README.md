## Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented in this repository:

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Computes the minimum spanning tree for a connected graph.
- **Stepping Stone Method**: Solves transportation problems to minimize costs while meeting supply and demand constraints.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Python**

## Installation

To use the algorithms in this repository, clone the repository and navigate to the respective language folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aitbenmoumen/Operational-Research-Algorithmes.git
cd Operational-Research-Algorithmes
```

### For Java
Make sure you have Java installed. You can compile and run the Java files using:

```bash
javac <FileName>.java
java <FileName>
```

### For Python
Ensure you have Python installed. You can run the Python scripts using:

```bash
python <FileName>.py
```

## Usage

Each algorithm has its own folder with a README file explaining how to use it, including input formats and expected outputs.

## Contributing
